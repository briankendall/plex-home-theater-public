New:
  * Internal testing showed that Matroska streaming that was announced in 1.0.12
    release notes did not work well with aspects of seeking and resuming. It has
    therefore been disabled while we figure these issues out. You can still try it
    out by adding <usematroskatranscode>on</usematroskatranscode> in your advancedsettings.xml
    but it will not work well with seeking and resuming. You have been warned.

 Fixes:
   * Fixed deadlock in "Please Wait" dialog when navigating TV Shows.
