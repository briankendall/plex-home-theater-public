New:
  * MUCH better transcoder streaming. When PMS 0.9.9.8 is released PHT will be able to do
    live matroska streaming instead of HTTP Live Streaming. This solves a lot of problems
    including:
    * Audio data is now copied into the matroska container, that means that even
      if you are transcoding you will get the full DTS/AC3 audio stream.
    * Caching now works properly with transcoding
    * Faster start-up and faster seek/resume than HLS.

Fixes:
  * Fix pre-play for TV-Shows.
  * Run window resizing barriers on all platforms.
  * Make plasma users happy by moving the clock and label in the fanart screensaver around a bit
  * Fix a VERY BAD connection discovery bug that has been around for way to long
  * Mute silly warning from curl.
  * Fix watch state when playing items from shared servers
  * Fix a few issues with "Please Wait" dialog when opening PrePlay
  * Several fixes to search window
  * Wake up screensaver and DPMS on playMedia and subscribe commands
  * Several crashes fixed.

Skin updates:
  * Change Title to Label in search results.
  * Resize the Unwatched indicators and some vertical position tweaks in Search.
  * Center "Searching" label vertically to the spinner.
  * Fix "Clips" search results layout.
  * Change "Clips" search results section to "Channels", and localize all section titles.
  * Home lists: show the episode information overlay on selected item.
  * Search: show unwatched overlay on selected item.
